A rectangle's length is twice its width. If the rectangle's perimeter is 36 meters, what are its length and width?
--- Answer ---
A rectangle's length is twice its width. If the rectangle's perimeter is 36 meters, what are its length and width? Explain your reasoning.

Let's denote the width of the rectangle as W and the length as L. According to the problem, the length is twice the width, so we can write this as:

L = 2W

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:

Perimeter = 2L +
